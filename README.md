# Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores
## Overview
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

In this project, we will take a look at data on SATs across public schools in New York City. Our database contains a single table:

SAT_Results.csv: Contains information on SAT scores by school.
The data was obtained from the following sources:

NYC Open Data
New York City Department of Education
Objectives
## The main objectives of this project are to:

Explore the data to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
Identify any trends or patterns in the data.
Create visualizations to help understand the data and communicate insights.
Analyze the relationship between SAT scores and demographics, such as race and income.
## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used to perform the analysis:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
## Results
The analysis produced the following results:

SAT scores are positively correlated with the percentage of students who are white or Asian, and negatively correlated with the percentage of students who are black or Hispanic.
Schools with higher percentages of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch tend to have lower SAT scores.
There is significant variation in SAT scores across schools in New York City.
## Conclusion
The analysis of SAT scores across public schools in New York City provides valuable insights into the relationship between demographics and academic achievement. The findings suggest that there are significant disparities in SAT scores based on race and income, and that schools with higher percentages of disadvantaged students tend to have lower SAT scores. These insights can help inform policy decisions aimed at improving educational outcomes for all students.

## Future Work
There are a number of potential avenues for future exploration based on this analysis, including:

Examining the relationship between SAT scores and other demographic factors, such as gender and language proficiency.
Investigating the reasons behind the disparities in SAT scores across different demographic groups and schools.
Evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving SAT scores, such as tutoring or targeted support for disadvantaged students.
